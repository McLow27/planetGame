_Space Blitz_ is a real-time strategy battle multiplayer game with sandbox and city-building elements. It takes place around the planet Saturn where all players are dropped off on one of its diverse moons. Controlling an army of droids on the uninhabitable moons, the ultimate goal of the player is to advance in science and technology, and take over the hostile moons while defending and ensuring the survival of the own colony.

### Moons
At the beginning of each round, all players get to choose a moon on which to start their colony. The moons all orbit a central planet and have different difficulties and advantages. The obstacle when trying to invade a hostile moon is that the defense is adapted to the moon’s unique terrain while the offense is not specialised for anything. Hence a good strategy is to invent and discover along the scientific tree of the moons one plans to attack and develop fitting technology.

### Resources & Mining
All moons contain a variety of ores and elements although different moons may provide different concentrations of resources. To keep it fair, the resource requirements of a moon's technology are adapted to the available elements. To mine ores, a player can open a new mining station within their map and dispatch robots to dig up the resources. For faster transport it is suggested to create an infrastructure between mines and headquarters. The ores are spread over the whole planet but with advancing science and the geology lab one can get approximate locations for elements.

##### A List of All Found Elements
_Keep in mind that this is abstract pseudoscience and extremely simplified._
| Element | Application Example |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| Fe (Iron) | Various technology |
| Al (Aluminium) | Various technology |
| H (Hydrogen) | Rocket fuel |
| Li (Lithium) | Lithium-ion batteries |
| C (Carbon) | Carbon-fibre |
| N (Nitrogen) | Explosives |
| O (Oxygen) | Rocket propellant |
| Mg (Magnesium) | Explosives |
| Si (Silicon) | Technology |
| S (Sulfur) | Gunpoweder/explosives |
| Ti (Titanium) | Metal |
| Cr (Chromium) | Stainless steel |
| Co (Cobalt) | Magnets |
| Ni (Nickel) | Armour |
| Cu (Copper) | Cable |
| Zn (Zinc) | Electronics |
| Pd (Palladium) | Computers |
| Ag (Silver) | Batteries/wire |
| In (Indium) | LCD screens |
| Hf (Hafnium) | Rocket boosters |
| Re (Rhenium) | Fighter jet engines |
| Pt (Platinum) | Computers |
| Au (Gold) | Computers |
| U (Uranium) | Nuclear power |
| Pu (Plutonium) | Radioactivity |

##### Asteroid Mining
With the development of space travel and asteroid mining, players can choose asteroids in the vicinity and dispatch a satellite to push the rock into a close orbit. Once the asteroid is orbiting the moon, rockets can lift off to mine the ores. Although this is very expensive in energy and resources, asteroids often contain rare elements in higher-than-usual quantities.
